# HRIS Time Chatbot PoC Specification

## Overview
This is a Proof of Concept (PoC) for a chatbot that provides access to HRIS Time repository data and actions. The PoC focuses on demonstrating functionality without implementing auth, storage, or other production concerns.

## Frontend Structure
- The frontend is built using Next.js with shadcn/ui components for the UI
- The main application is in `apps/time-copilot/`
- The chatbot interface should be a simple text-based chat UI

## Mastra Integration
- The project uses mastraClient to access specialized tools
- Mastra integration code will be located in `apps/time-copilot-api/`
- The chatbot will use mastra agents with custom tools to access HRIS data

## Key Functionalities
The chatbot should support the following use cases:
1. View leaves (employee absences)
2. View time planning information
3. View balance forecast for time off
4. Add a new leave request

## User Flow
- Users interact with a simple text-based chat interface
- The chatbot processes natural language requests
- Relevant HRIS data is fetched and presented to the user
- For this PoC, all users will have admin access (all data visible)

## Technical Implementation
- Frontend: Next.js React application with shadcn/ui components in an NX repo
- Backend tools: Custom Mastra tools that integrate with HRIS Time APIs
- Data flow: User request → mastraClient → HRIS Time API → formatted response
